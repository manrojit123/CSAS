          <p>CSAS seeks to bring together thought leaders from the spheres of biology, Buddhism, education, medicine, 
            psychology, and the sciences of information and cognition. We are committed to conduct multidisciplinary 
            research comprehensively, critically and constructively.</p>

        <p>As a research network with global participation and a physical
            presence in Kathmandu, Nepal, CSAS is also inspired by the
            Himalayas—a region that since ancient times has been a fountainhead
            of spiritual and philosophical traditions, many of which are still
            studied and practiced to this day. Yet this region is also extremely
            vulnerable to global warming and environmental degradation (often
            leading to scarcity of resources and communal conflict) as well as
            geopolitical clashes of interest that impact billions in South and
            East Asia, and so also the world at large. In this way, our
            immediate environment abounds with rich resources for human
            flourishing, just as it presents powerful challenges. Our aim is
            then to learn from and respond to our environment—with scientific
            rigor and spiritual depth.
