             <p>CSAS seeks to bring together thought leaders from the spheres of biology, Buddhism, education, medicine, psychology, and the sciences of information and cognition. We are committed to conduct multidisciplinary research comprehensively, critically and constructively.</p>

            <p><span class="fw-600">Comprehensively</span>, since members of CSAS collaborate continuously over extended periods of time, seeking to engender mutual knowledge transfers, with the view to concrete application within science, religion and  society-at-large.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-600">Critically</span>, because the recognition of conceptual opaqueness, operational weaknesses, or mismatches between aspiration and practice within oneâ€™s own community and its interfaces with human society and the global ecosystem remain explicit objectives.</p>
            <p><span class="fw-600">Constructively</span>, because our aim is to describe, critique, and model caring intelligences in ways that map to concepts in biology, Buddhism and cognitive science and are relevant for the development of AI.</p>
